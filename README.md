# infoAR
Created for DeltaHacks 2018.

## The Problem
The problem we tried to tackle is the lack of communication between workers and their surroundings. Imagine a future where a technician can walk through a plant and be presented with statistics about the equipment through augmented reality! From machine errors to schedules for maintenance, everything would be connected online and accessible by all components of the supply chain. Additionally, safety messages and alerts could be displayed as they occur, preventing workplace injuries and fatalities.

## Our Solution
Using AR technology, we have designed an app that detects images and displays a variety of machinery information, like the status, maintenance schedule, and errors. By providing a worker with this technology, we believe that both efficiency and safety is greatly improved. To create this application, we used Unity3D with the built-in Vuforia AR plugin, C# for application scripts, and Google SketchUp for 3D modelling.

## Future Goals
We would like to combine this AR application with a real-time IoT system that detects machinery information (ex. temperature, vibrations) in order to present workers with the most accurate information about their surroundings. Additionally, through this IoT system, we would like to add the functionality of predictive maintenance, where the IoT system detects failures before they occur and alert technicians.

## Skills Learned
Everything! None of us had any experience using any of the languages or programs used to create this app. While the learning curve was big, it was great exploring an innovative technology that has an amazing capacity to revolutionize how we interact with our environment!
